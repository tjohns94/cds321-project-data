It tastes like a pee to me. Tastes like peas. >> Yeah, you're right. >> Does it taste like peas? >> It tastes exactly like peas. This is a relinia fruit and it's supposed to taste like lemon mering pie. Do I think it's better than the last one? Yes. >> Is it good? No. Now we've got Buddha's hand. This is the world's oldest citrus fruit. Can't smell nothing from Buddha's hands. He's not giving me anything. >> You shoved it up my nose. >> Oh, woo. >> Let me get in on that. >> Get in on it. >> I'm eating Buddha's hand right now. Like, literally, his fingers are in my mouth. >> This is probably a four out of 10. >> Melic. >> No. This is a $150 crown melon from Japan. >> Oh my god. That is the most juicy melon I've ever sunk my teeth into. >> I swear to God, this is a 10 out of 10. >> And for the final fruit, we have the $400 Ruby Glow Pineapple. >> Why isn't it glowing? >> I mean, it's red. >> Cheers. >> Oh my god, man. This is a 100 out of 10. >> It actually is incredible. >> I love this. This is great. >> But have you tried the new Fastable Sour Strikes that come in four fruit flavors? >> That's a 10 out of 10.
