    "transcript": "After completely reinventing the peanut butter cup and proving that our design could hold more flavor and creamy filling than anything else out there, we realized we were on to something massive. You see, while most companies would stick with what's working, we couldn't stop thinking about one simple question. If our new cups could hold more creamy peanut butter than anyone thought possible, what else could we fill them with? And after brainstorming everything from birthday cake to brownie batter, we kept coming back to one of the world's most beloved flavor combination, chocolate and hazelnut. made popular by Nutella, the famous chocolate hazelnut spread that has been in pantries around the world for decades. And so we decided if we could create our own original take on chocolate and hazelnut, we might just have our second flavor. So we started by sourcing every single type of hazelnut, blonde, traditional, roasted, raw, and then started deciding between hazelnut pieces or hazelnut paste. And finally deciding what ratio of chocolate to nuts would give us the perfect balance we're looking for. And after months of tweaking ratios, adjusting textures, and literally tasting hundreds of variations, we finally landed on our own unique chocolate hazelnut blend. And after sending the cups to some of our creator friends, they didn't just like them. [Music] >> He did it again. You killed it, Jimmy. >> They love them. Now, here's the thing. We're launching these hazelnut cups at Five Below, Circle K, and Albertson's as a test run to see if people are as excited about these as we are. And with your help, we can prove to retailers that this flavor belongs on storeshelves permanently. So go try the brand new hazelnut cups while you still can.",
