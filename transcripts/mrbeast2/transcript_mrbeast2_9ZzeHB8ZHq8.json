They're are lightning bullshaped gummies, and they come in four fruit flavors: watermelon, strawberry, raspberry, and green apple. And if you particularly love raspberries, you can get a bag of only that flavor. And as you can see on the front, they're made with no artificial dyes, no artificial sweetener, ethically sourced sugar, and they taste amazing. If you want to give these bad boys a try, go to your local Target, 7-Eleven, or Speedway nationwide.",
