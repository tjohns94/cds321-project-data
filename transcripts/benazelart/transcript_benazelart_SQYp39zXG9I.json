    "transcript": "Today was the luckiest day ever. Let me explain. It all started at the Mega Experience where I brought my new packs of Pokemon Mega Evolution cards with hopes to pull a gold. I made my way through the Mega Experience and walked past the craziest art and cards. And now it was time to open the packs. Here we go. >> Pack after pack, I was searching for the gold. Maybe if I open packs with famous YouTubers, I'll have extra luck. So, I tried with CHC, Matthew Beam, and even Jesser. >> Mega Venusaur, >> but it's not gold. >> And right after that, someone right next to me pulled a gold. This is a good sign. >> We got more cards. Let's keep going. So far, I found some crazy Pokémon cards like a strudel, a mega Venusaur, but no gold. So, I knew what I had to do. All right, Pikachu. I need a gold in here. You got me? Oh, okay. Let's go open this one. And then this happened. Thanks to the Pokemon International Company for having me. I got the gold. Let's go.",
