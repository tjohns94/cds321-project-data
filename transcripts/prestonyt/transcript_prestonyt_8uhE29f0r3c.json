Trust me. >> I'm building the Lego set. >> I ran the calculations. I'm thinking maybe a few hours for me, but for Gabriel, I just don't think it's possible. >> It's been a while. I've only painted this much. Can everybody help me, please? Look at all this bus I have left. >> That's a lot of bus. >> Look at this. We're making some progress. Poor Gabriel. Man's just alone, huh? >> I rallied six people. We're all painting. How much we done? I bet Preston doesn't even have a crew or even have a bus. Like, where's he at right now? Oh no, don't come up. I'm bringing in backups just so this goes down. >> You're supposed to be the wizard. I hope Gabriel is having a little bit of struggle. >> The bus is fully painted. Next up is wheels. Let's get painting. >> This is what makes Lego sets fun is when you have friends involved. At this rate, I will start thanking the bus driver. >> We're almost done. What's next are the accessories. Preston's probably just still just sleeping on the couch. >> I mean, we're pretty much there. Lego set complete. Now we get to go check on Gabriel. Poor Gabriel. That guy doesn't stand a chance. >> Does this count? It sucks to be you, Preston.",
