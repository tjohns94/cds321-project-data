They're literally searching for me and I'm in the air. >> There is no way I'm going to let these boys find Preston before I do. He could be anywhere cuz you can't hide from the best bounty hunter in the state of Texas. >> Place is huge. Preston is going to waste so much talking. It's so loud. >> What kind of mcrafter am I? Lego Brick League challenge me to find out. >> Preston. Man, there's a lot of little places to hide in here. >> I don't feel comfortable going up there. I'm going to search every single tiny crevice underneath everything and I'm going to find Preston. I know you're there. We might be able to build this before we find this. This part's easy. There's going to be a secret passageway here somewhere. I know it. >> Vote for me at lego.com to help me win the brickly challenge. >> I'm starting to get suspicious that it's not going to be a cabinet. They pounded on something. >> It looks disturbing. Look. >> Don't tell us. >> This is super suspicious. >> Preston, >> you have the wrong person. It's too late. What do you think here, >> man?",
