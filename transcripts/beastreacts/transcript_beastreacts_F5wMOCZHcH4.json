like that was just extra credit the tank won which means Chris has one point and Carl has zero and whoever at the end of the video has the least amount of points has to get in a convertible car and go through the car wash you should have told me that before I sided against a tank better in your trunks buddy yellow robot versus red Carl's in last place what do you pick yellow robot which means you take red I hate the color red let's see who wins katees iron Glory here we go the red looks beefier though the yellow one looks cool but the yellow one has a machine gun yeah of course he's going to win he has a machine gun the red has a claw bro don't bring a claw to a machine gun fight what is this also like who has this Warehouse what is going on can we do this oh they're in oh they can't shoot them with rockets in right no wait there's actually people in there wow that was pretty antil climatic red robot wins Chris now has two points and Carl still has zero 16 cars versus wedge truck it's the thing from GTA that's the thing from Mad Max the thing from Mad Max okay which means you have the 16 car that means I'm going to lose 100% this makes it come on 1 2 3 four five 6 seven all seven rows W that was kind of a given though Carl has one Chris has two kangaroo versus professional boxer kangaroo professional boxer well you didn't get a choice you got his leftovers [Music] fight wait is this real wait how is this allowed how is this what is going on oh what kangaroo wins what just happened a kangaroo won a boxing match dummy were you not paying attention you tied it is what happened okay now I'm allowed to pick whatever I want trucks versus monster truck monster truck I'll go the other ones I think the truck messes up there's no way the monster truck wins no shot what on God's green what in Hill belly nation is that trucks win Carl went from painstaking in last to in front of you how does it feel to be million light years ahead and now in last place I don't think you know how Lighty years work he's a sore loser five brick walls versus car I get to choose first you do get to choose first take some time to think and uh main Channel video One brick wall couldn't stop a train that is fair now leverage that knowledge to decide if five brick walls can stop a car I'm going to go ahead and vote on the brick wall being the winner which means you're left with the car silly boy but what I did mention is the car has a jet engine just kidding the car doesn't have a driver yeah what all I need conclusive results wait a minute what's more conclusive than that brother these are some crappy built brick walls the train almost got stopped by our brick wall listen to the beautiful voice Carl wins Carl has another point oh it's cold outside cuz the car wash yeah that you're currently on track to do yeah did you forget that was the thing I did actually it's probably going to snow anyways 16 people versus Tyler one this is 16 people versus Tyler one Chris you're in last who do you pick so I see foolish so I know that's got to be a l on that side so I'm going to go with Tyler one do you really think Tyler one can beat 16 people by himself you can't it's not 16 normal people it's 16 streamers get the muscles on these competitors no shot yeah he does no way yeah he does Tyler is determined is that letting the front of this round go anywhere dig in Tyler dig dig Chris you just wanted to go in this car wash that's Hassan Hassan he's not nothing compared to Tyler musles yes Tyler yes this can't be real Nick a30 Tyler one before his left side trying to keep it going and there it is they mocked me for knowing that Tyler was the powerfullest God Tyler w wins you better grab an umbrella Bud well he's still in the lead yeah I'm still in the lead by the way four to three win one more then you can make that joke yeah and then we'll be TI stop being on his side you're the scorekeeper you're not supposed to be biased th hammer versus truck what do you pick truck thr Hammer easy yeah I knew it was going to be hacksmith but I couldn't remember how big it was oh it's the giant one I thought it was the small one Hammer wins wait did the truck win though I cuz that's what you picked right you won but he got first his dibs and he still lost it's 5-3 5-3 we've officially gotten to the score that is Chris's height by three man versus largest plane in the world why would we watch this if he failed of course a plane is going to win so it has to be the man man I'll go plane because it's big that's a good form the pl is pretty good form too to be fair yeah look at that form you picked the man too I did pick the man you think he's going to pull through it's going to be a photo finish what is this the way it's like a rugby team I think and they wouldn't have uploaded this if he got beat by a plane woo my logic was right screw you even if you didn't agree with it now it's 54 now it's officially Carl Jacobs height check it on Wikipedia mascots versus footballers I'm going to go ahead and say mascot cuz it's silly I love mascots though so this one's sad but I'll go football players oh wait they're playing football come on [Applause] what y

I'm saying cuz it's all tied up is 55 now first come first serve next one turtle versus rabbit Turtle you know what I'll let you have that I'm going to go rabbit turtle versus rabbit yeah yeah the rabbit's going to be dumb and get distracted yeah turn around yeah go rabbits are dumb Turtles are motivated yeah that's millions of years of evolution you're literally rooting for my guy he picked Turtle you picked rabbit wait I pick Turtle I forgot I forgot how it worked oh my God yeah that's millions of years of evolution I'm an idiot Turtle wins I was right though I knew the turtle would win you just didn't pick it I actually lost that round because I looked like an idiot not only because I lost a point well I mean we can subtract two if you want hydraulic press versus Diamond what do you pick hydraulic press what the only thing that could break diamond is Diamond you are so silly diamonds are made by hydraulic press of the earth say your pick I said hydraulic press just want to make sure it wasn't a rabbit where you switch it I didn't even choose the rabbit he choose I got second helpin and I wasn't even paying attention you're right you're right you're right that's not a real diamond number one that's so it's just glass and it's going to shatter I pick diamond oh oh even if it's real it's still shattered so I don't care because I won you thought I was an idiot that ties it
