    "transcript": "have you ever wondered what it's like to be a fish or a dog well I found clips of people strapping GoPros on animals we can see what their lives are like POV bird oh my gosh how did they get the GoPro on the bird how does the GoPro not weighing the bird down I have so many questions oh you can see the bird shadow on the mountain bro is this what a bird's life is like you're just looking for rabbits and stuff and looking for a place to perch so birds can just fly why didn't we do that why do we choose being able to talk over flying that's the worst trade-off in the history of evolution ever oh there's other birds I wonder if he's like yo I hate those birds or if those other birds are as homies or he's like how's the weather up here well no because they know because they're up there oh yeah for this next clip they didn't have to put a GoPro on a lion he just ate it the lion decided he's gonna be the cameraman oh wait I got to turn my head like this I'm gonna say it I think this line should be a YouTuber no way he puts it upright oh my god oh he's filming him [Applause] yeah he's like yo vlogging with the boys today we're going to be running across the Savannah bro what are the odds that this happened the fact that he picked it up put it down switch the camera facing out and is filming his friend I want to buy this line how funny is it that Nat Geo like pays people millions of dollars to go here and film and they could have just given the camera to the line yeah this is crazy this is one of the coolest things I've ever seen all right so this guy's a GoPro on what is going on is that shark music yeah it's shark music that shark was like hey how you doing bro you can feel the Panic at him did you see how quickly that shark just didn't exist anymore watch

not pretty cool next clip oh Vlog style he's like all right today boys we're gonna be hitting a lick on some dummy feeding us strawberries so this the monkey took the camera but that monkey's hand

spins this is it it's literally spinning boom and here's the best part watch this the hog is like yo where'd you come from I love how you caught it a hug hog rider oh God okay so basically in baseball after you hit the ball you drop the bat most horrible organizations have another human pick it up exactly they use a dog you know what kind of dog he is Jimmy what a Labrador Retriever oh we got both pieces oh my gosh oh my God they trained him he's incredible I would watch baseball if both teams had dogs and then after they swung the dog's race to see which one could pick up the bat I would watch baseball if all the players were dogs and then it was just dogs playing baseball epic car ride oh GoPro on a Hot Wheels someone sent me a mile long of Hot Wheel tracks and I'm gonna go to the beach and do this for fun please Hot Wheels do something with us we love you watching a GoPro out of a cannon oh this is sick crazy so what whoa POV your Buzz Lightyear oh my gosh wow we're up here does he

footage this fish can capture oh my God look at its face up here put it back in the water it's like yo guys this giant God over there just lifted me up guys guys so what have we learned today animals are great at being cameraman I'm gonna do this one to why because it looks so much fun what's on that paper in the bottom right it's all the turns jumps and like things the driver needs to know if you're going that fast that someone has to warn you of a turn or you'll die I think you're going too fast oh they put little things in the way there's all kinds of obstacles there's all kinds of different turns this is the European Countryside these are real streets that they close off so you need to know like if it's going to be a hard right or a jump like he's saying so you don't fly over
