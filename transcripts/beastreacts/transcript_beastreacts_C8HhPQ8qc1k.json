    "transcript": "I have a list of the weirdest World Records ever from the longest human Domino chain to the furthest Ever Walked on Legos to a guy balancing a car on his head what the heck are these records I don't know but they only get weirder from here starting with this guy who smashed the most walnuts with his elbow boom boom boom W go he's going really fast he has impeccable form I don't even think I can move my arm that fast much oh he missed one he missed one he missed a nut he's getting tired he slowed down tremendously but that's still so impressive wow that scream was nuts you know what's cooler than smashing walnuts with your elbow everything this 6-year-old kid wow that is actually wait what yeah how did I do that I just I don't even know how to put into words this tiny six-year-old is taken the limbo skating well by storm yeah that's definitely a world record I don't think anybody can beat that I didn't know that limbo skating was a thing how do you tell that kid you're like get back here and then he scoots under a bunch of cars like you can't keep up with him if you have a big butt then you can never be a limbo skater Kim Kardashian can never be a limo skater well she can now cuz she got her butt removed what what do you mean she got her BBL taken out really mhm oh why' you keep up with Kardashian news I like the Kardashians okay this is probably not the fastest onion eating because I watched a video of the shrekfest and there's an onion eating competition the shout out to Ryan trean well let's see if they beat this time okay let's see I I'm skeptical that guy destroyed it their onions were way bigger that's what she said wow he's eating the whole thing well you have to it's an onion eating competition you have to eat the onion the whole onion wowed running worst breath in the world wow flat at 30 and if you thought these world records were cool keep watching most people to fit in a Mini Cooper I'm going to say six maybe oh they're like contortionists I just can't tell if this is real news or not I'm ready we have 26 people 26 people in a Mini Cooper look at his face that would suck to be the person who had to go in first and then have to wait for the 26th person to get in there the easiest one would be the last one yeah dims on last imagine if you get claustrophobic 3 2 one we got it why the countdowns they always do that what's it going to like burst open and they're just going to come flying out like pool noodles wow they're all just dancing around yeah to be the record he must type this specific sentence another 47 seconds so he's the world's fastest nose typer does he have like no arms or does he just like typing with his nose it looks like he has arms he just isn't using them all right Beat It by 1 second wow shattered it proud of his nose hey that previous guy's crying oh is he jump rope no this is the world's fastest jump roading with roller skates on it's probably the most in a certain amount of time which is the world's fastest yeah but you say it weird he's going I'm going to do this but with high heels I'm going to find some shoe no one's worn so I can steal world record I think somebody's definitely done this in high heels they didn't do it effectively you think you could do it better got a lot of high heill experience I saw him one time all right I don't know if this guy's name is Bill but he looks like a bill head balancer. comom you think that domain's still in use does he really balance it on his head head oh my God bill bill doesn't have a spine anymore holy crap all it
