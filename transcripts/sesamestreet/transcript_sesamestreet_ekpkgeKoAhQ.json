(Julian and child laugh) Yeah, yes. - Do you want to see what\nyou're wearing right now? Here.\n- Hmm? What is that? - I'm just showing you yourself. You're dressed like a firefighter. - You are right, that is a firefighter. - That's you. - That is me. That would explain why it has\nbeen so hot at work lately. (Julian laughing) - Emma, I heard you have a really good impression of a chicken. Felix, you want to see that? - I would love to see\nEmma's chicken impression. (Emma clucking) - Whoa, you just turned into\na chicken for a second there. (Julian clucking) - That was amazing. Do you want to see my person impression? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, go. - Hello, there. I need\nsome coffee, please. - Oh, that's me. What do you love about Halloween? - Trick-or-treating. - Whoa. - Trick-or-treat. - Have you ever been trick-or-treating? - Oh, I do it all. I do it every year. - Really?\n- Yes. - Do you wear a costume or do you just go? - No, I wear a costume. I follow the rules. - Zoe, why do you think\nkids like Halloween so much? - I think it's the candy. - That's the candy. - Oh, that's what I was thinking, too. It's not the being scared? - I don't think so. - Why do they say trick or treat? What does that mean? Elmo and I are trying to figure this out. - Yeah. - Can you please give me\nsome candy or something? (Elmo laughing) - Maybe we should change it this year. Instead of trick or treat, it's can you please give\nus some candy or something? (Zoe and Elmo laughing) - Wait, I have a fun idea. What if we pretend that you two are trick-or-treating together and you're coming to my\nhouse to get some candy? - Okay, ready? - Are you ready?\n- Ding dong. Ding dong. - Ding dong. - Try knocking. - Oh, knock. - Knock, knock, knock. - Hi, so sorry. My doorbell's broken. What are you doing here? - Give us some candy or something. - Yeah (laughing). - Oh, he doesn't know the new phrase. - Sorry, yeah. What?\n- Trick or treat. - Oh, trick-or-treat, yes, okay. So I'm gonna give you\na trick, is that okay? - Maybe? - Uh, okay. - Or did you more want the treat? - We were kind of hoping for a treat. - Here's a ton of candy, a giant bag of a million pieces of candy. - Thank you!\n- Wow, thank you. - You just ate all of it at once? You're gonna explode. (Zoe and Elmo laughing) - That's what the Cookie\nMonster does, too. - Why do you like to be a firefighter? - Well, until just a couple minutes ago, I did not know I was a firefighter. - Okay, so. - But you know what? I do like it, and they\nkeep us safe, right? - Yes, and if there's a fire, I think I know what to do. If I were you, I would\njust get the hose out and then spray everything in the building. - (gasping) That is such a good idea. I can use this hose--\n- For water, yeah! - To put out that fire. - I know you've just\nbeen watching, Grover, but you could be proactive, I think. - Yes, yes, that is exactly\nwhat I'm going to do. - And anyway, just look out for fire so that it won't burn you. - Zoe, how much candy is too much candy? - Maybe 500 to 1,600 pieces. - Whoa. - I would say that's too much candy. - That's probably too much. - What if this Halloween, people gave out vegetables\ninstead of candy? How would you feel about that? - Kids won't be that excited. - But, you know, candy\nis a sometimes food, and Halloween is the\nperfect sometimes for candy. - It's only once a year. - It's just once a year. Come on.\n- Come on. - Give us a break. - Come on, it's just once a year. - Come on. - Come on. - Just for the day. (Zoe laughing) - Who did you dress up as, or who are you gonna\ndress up as this year? - Like a mariachi. I know how to speak Spanish. - Wait a minute, you could speak Spanish? (Julian speaking foreign language) (both speaking foreign language) - Can you teach me some Spanish, Emma? - Si. - Oh, si. What does that mean? - That means yes. - Oh, I can speak Spanish now, si. - Your name. - Yeah? - In Espanol, pollo. - Pollo.\n- Pollo, I love it. - It's cute, right? - Pollo, pollo. Felix the pollo. (laughing) I love it. (group laughing) - Cookie, what do you get scared of? - Well, me get scared of\nthings that are new sometimes. - I'm not scared of anything. - Wow. - I'm scared of the same thing\nthat Cookie Monster said. - Yeah. - You're scared of new things sometimes. - Yeah.\n- Yeah. - I totally understand that. What do you do to get over that fear? - I just remember people are nice here. - Everyone's a little\nnervous to meet each other, but then everybody wants\nto be making friends and everybody wants to be\nhaving a positive time, right? - Yeah, and sometimes\nyou meet great people, like me meeting you two today. - Yeah.\n- Me have two new friends. - [Julian] Yeah. - Cookie Monster, have you\never met an owl before? - No, me never met an owl. Me seen an owl. - [Both] Have you ever met an owl before? - I saw its babies, too. (bell dinging) - Miles, what does it feel\nlike when you're scared? What is that feeling like inside? - I may have forgot, because\nI got scared a few months ago. - Whoa. - You are super brave. - Grover, can you handle scary things? - Oh, no. No, no, no, I do not like scary things. Scary things make me scared. - One time a person popped\nout of a garbage can and scared everybody. - Well, that happens a lot.\n- Really? That happens all the\ntime on Sesame Street. - Could I try to scare you? Would that be okay? - I would probably bounce back. - Okay, let's try it. Can you look away for a second? - Okay.\n- Miles, watch this. Hey, Grover, turn around. - Who is that? What is that? - Hello, Grover. (group laughing) How was that, was that good? - That was a scary voice. - Have you ever been scared,\nlike not in a Halloween way, but like meeting new\npeople or out in the world? - I've been scared of\ngoing to my new school. After, I made a lot of\nnew friends at the school, so I'm not that scared. - Things that are new are a little scary, but then you get used to it. - Grover, are you brave? - Um. - Eh. - I pretend to be sometimes. (Julian laughing) - Can I see your brave face? - Okay. (bell dinging) - Whoa. - How about that? - Miles, can I see your brave face? (bells tinkling) - Mm. (bells chiming) - I think for Halloween, I think I'm gonna dress\nup as my favorite thing. Do you know what it is? - Uh-uh. - Corn. - Mm. - I love corn. - In Spanish, it's called elote. - Elote means corn in Spanish? I'm learning so much from you, Emma. - Bok. - Bok, bok. - What do you like about Halloween? - It's saying trick-or-treat, and then they come to the door and give me little chocolates. - Do you ever get scared on Halloween? - Nope. Yes, yes, and Frank. - Frank? - Who's Frank? Is he a hot dog? - No, he's a scary guy. - Oh, like Frankenstein with the flat head and the bolts coming out of his neck? - Yes. - That's Frankenstein. He walks like this. (thunder rumbling) - And I just be brave. - You're brave? - You gotta do that, Abby. - Tell me how to be brave. - Don't panic. You just stand still. You take a deep breath and\nthen you just try to do it. I was brave and I didn't even cry. - [Julian] Good job, Abby. - Oh, I love the loves. Oh, you know what your superpower is? - What? - Super kindness with that hug. I felt it right in my heart. - That's 'cause I love you. - Oh, I love you, too. - When you two get scared, what do you do to make\nyourselves feel better? - Find my favorite snuggle\nbear and I snuggle it. - But you don't have your\nsnuggle bear all the time. - No, I do not, it is true. Sometimes I have a friend\nwho can give me a hug. You know what? I have been through a lot in\nthe past couple of minutes. Could you give me a hug? - Yes. - Oh... thank you. I feel much better now. - I just have to ask him something that's not about Halloween. - That's okay. You can ask that, too. - Do you know how to do a double knot? Because I don't. - No, Elmo can't tie his shoes\nyet, because you know why? Elmo doesn't wear shoes. (Zoe laughing) You like Elmo's dinosaur feet? - Yeah. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay. - All right, Elmo. Lovely talking to you about Halloween. - And lovely talking to you, but you know how you say goodbye and thanks for talking in dinosaur? - I have an idea. (group roaring) - Awesome. Thank you, Zoe. - Yeah. - Thank you, Elmo. - Yeah. - Should we all say Happy Halloween? - Yeah.\n- Yeah. - [Group] Happy Halloween. - [Group] Happy Halloween. - [Group] Happy Halloween. - Me gonna go eat me costume now. - [Julian] Bye.
