    "transcript": "This is waterfall fried chicken, and it's one of the most\nviral street foods in Vietnam. They start by pre-cooking some\nchicken and then turning on this hot oil waterfall, which sounds almost exactly\nlike heavy rainfall. Once the chicken crisps up and turns\na beautiful golden brown color, they flip it over to get a\ncrust on the bottom side. And once it's fully cooked, they drain off the excess oil\nand rest it for a few moments to lock in all the juices. It's served with an orange fried\nrice that's cooked by a robot, as well as fresh vegetables.",
