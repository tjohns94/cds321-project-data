    "transcript": "Dora told us that she had a surprise for us Dora houses and offers education to over 400 children unfortunately last year they experienced a devastating storm that completely destroyed several dormitories it is because of all of you that donated to the fundraiser in the last video that Dora had just enough to rebuild these dorms and after months of hard work the Reconstruction of the building was finally complete so as of today this house will no longer be called the boy's house it will be called the best philanthropy h having this house dedicated to Beast philanthropy is a massive honor to each and every one of us because Beast philanthropy is all of us you see without your support we wouldn't be able to do projects like this and I want you to know how much we love and appreciate you every one of us has the ability to make a difference in somebody else's life [Music]",
