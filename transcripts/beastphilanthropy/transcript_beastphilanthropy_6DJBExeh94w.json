    "transcript": "around a 100,000 Americans passed away in 2023 from a disease that almost no one understands America is facing a record high number of addiction places over 48.7 million Americans are living with substance use disorder and millions more directly and indirectly impacted I'm an addict if I have a drink I can't stop everyone's safety is at stake it is an uncontrolled fire someone close to home offered to give us a more personal perspective on addiction my name is Dan and I'm an addict and alcoholic and I have been in recovery for the last 11 years Dan started working with Beast philanthropy as the chief creative officer almost 2 years ago and during his continuous hard work to make these films he still suffers with his addiction on a daily basis the hardest part is remaining clean having to constantly remind oneself like life can look so great from the outside but it's a it's a daily um struggle and it's forever but that's why we say just for today so Dan and I we've been working together a little bit over a year and a half I've learned spending so much time with him where I've completely changed my mind about what an addict is when we heard about Phoenix a program that uses new methods to help members return to a sober life with a high success rate of recovery where eight in 10 active members remain sober I really wanted to go there with Dan to learn more about this to be honest before I came here I said to Darren like I don't know how to feel about this I was still very on the fence with this idea but I think that's changed after speaking to Scott founder of The Phoenix Program I'm Scott Strode I'm in recovery and I'm also the executive director and the founder of the Phoenix Scott started the Phoenix as a result of his past struggles with alcohol and substance abuse his experience of turning his life around was sparked from converting his bad weekend habits into a healthy active lifestyle surrounded by like-minded people my own addiction story started from the environment I grew up in through sober events and activities members Bond over who they want to become strong in mind and body we realized we couldn't get to enough people that needed support and so we opened up the chance for folks to volunteer to start Phoenix and that's when we really grew to scale a lot of Phoenix happens outside of buildings out in the community with bike rides and runs and Hikes and other things I think this the Phoenix and places like this that exist it's very new age maybe it is a way in which recovery can work it's a beautiful thing we sat down with Jessica and Tiffany who turned to the Phoenix for their own recovery and now find meaning from helping others find theirs I was really hopeless depressed I knew I needed help but I hid my disease from my family no one knew I had a problem because I didn't live at home I was using much harder drugs I had no more like reservations and addiction and my life got really dark it took 2 years of me really going on a merry go round of substances I picked up heroin again and I overdosed and my biggest fear is losing my son I can't imagine being without me and I don't want to fail him I was homeless in the streets of Boston so I went to wake up the guy that was next to me and he didn't move for like 30 seconds in that really short frame of time I thought to myself like oh my goodness he's dead and like he woke up he was fine but just very quickly I turned it around on myself the final thought was I don't want to die I can't be alone in a place and know that everything's going to be okay I'm knowing you're strong enough to do that you're going to have to find someone in the same position as yourself and you guys are going to have to try to figure that out to get that and that's why this program exists I had been in treatment for so long and I always had to say Jessica I'm an addict Jessica I'm an addict Jessica I'm an addict and I felt that I would always have to be known as that and I became became really ashamed of myself but walking into the Phoenix and they told me just introduce yourself however you want it changed everything for me I I became really proud of myself I wasn't ashamed I didn't feel like I had to walk around with a Scarlet Letter I did this workout and I had um confidence that selfworth that like feeling of belonging you can feel like this without using drugs I know I'm an addict I know what I did on that never forget my past but I don't always have to be known for that either and and the Phoenix gave me that back I claim my name back that same feeling that we chased that same feeling that I chased for so many years um has been right here we have an ethos here at the Phoenix is that we're here to lift each other up so you come in and Phoenix is for you in the beginning and then you realize you can use your unique gifts to help others heal on their path and that's real Community that's how we help each other Rise is through Community it is through volunteers like Jessica and Tiffany that the Phoenix has reached and helped hundreds of thousands of people in their recovery through facilitating an environment built around Fitness love and Community led by like-minded people all these people from all these different walks of life all share one common problem and they get to hope it each other out with that problem every single day and that's a beautiful thing through our time at Phoenix it's become so evident that addiction could be affecting anyone around us but luckily there are amazing communities like Phoenix that are making successful strides in providing a solution this program is free but raising money is a constant struggle one thing we're trying to raise money for right now is our digital app Millions around the world struggling with addiction can't find the help they need this app can change that but we need your support to make it a reality so with our partners from Stand

where there's breath There's Hope and now that's how I see the addiction crisis everybody that's part of it can actually be part of the solution too Tiffany's story really inspired us and we wanted to show it after a long road of substance abuse and through her determination and sobriety Tiffany had found her passion I had been doing CrossFit for 2 months I was hooked I was hooked into the community the atmosphere the open I used CrossFit as my therapy Tiffany had a natural gift for CrossFit and through all her training was finally given the opportunity to compete in a competition that only the top 40 CrossFit athletes in the world can compete at but attending this event is expensive and she has had to find a way to fund this journey herself we were so moved by her unwavering
