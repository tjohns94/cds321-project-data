    "transcript": "what if I told you you could help tens of thousands of people live a better life without ever leaving your couch by just clicking on a thumbnail and watching a video you can help provide electricity to Villages rebuild entire towns and save rhinos from Extinction it's because of every one of you supporting the Beast philanthropy channel that we were able to accomplish all of this in 2024 we kicked off the Year by traveling to a secluded Village in Guatemala called cheezy Guan the people of this remote Village struggle with the basic necessities of life like clean water safe housing and proper education not to mention powerful storms that can destroy their handbuilt rudimentary homes we want to come and help this community we want to make a big difference for them so in Just 4 days we built 15 new houses that are fully equipped with everything these people need to live much more comfortably and it was finally time for these people to move into their new homes let's cut the r on top of that we also built a community center providing additional classrooms for the school as well as facilities that can be used to teach the women of the village new skills to support their families and [Music] Community next up we headed to Mexico where we worked with Operation Smile to provide Aid to people born with a cleft lip and pallet every year over 200,000 children are born with these conditions leading to many problems eating breathing and talking worst of all these kids face bullying and isolation from other children people of Rural and poor communities often receive little to no treatment at all we wanted to help so we partnered with Operation Smile to pay for 100 surgeries they're going to be having a life change Forever After the procedure is completed many of these children will be able to smile for the first time our patients are going to have the opportunity to actually have a normal life the Beast philanthropy team then flew out to Nepal and traveled to the remote Village of clagon after a warm welcome we found out more about the problems these locals face due to their isolation this community has no electricity meaning that local doctors have no access to proper medical equipment if more complex care was needed it would take hours to walk to a better medical facility Darren met up with a local give power engineer named Sanjay who told him a tragic story about Nera she had to travel in the Monson roads and then since the Bing Center was far away she couldn't reach to the biring center and had to lose the baby and due to a lack of government funding this Hospital would not get electricity until at least 2030 together with our partners give power and the green program we installed a solar power system and batteries to power the hospital as well as provide the equipment needed to create a safe and modern birthing center together with the community we turned a broken building with no electricity into a fully operational hospital that will service over 16,000 people in this community later that night the whole village came to the hospital to witness the lights turn on for the first time are you ready 3 2 1 seeing the lights come on for the first time in a community it never gets old over the year we completed three projects in Africa starting off in Uganda where hundreds of thousands of local people in rural Villages live in extreme poverty most of these people live off of as little as1 or $2 a day meaning getting an education starting a business receiving adequate health care or even electricity is nearly impossible to help alleviate this problem we teamed up with give directly to dispense cash grants directly to hundreds of families in a community to give them a chance to lift themselves and their families out of the cycle of generational poverty they had been trapped in when cash goes to a community even business in that Community is boosted this cash enables them to go for their needs together with give directly we were able to fund around 300 local families with a cash Grant equivalent to what they would earn in a typical year for hundreds of years going back these people have not had opportunity but now moving forward they have opportunity and they can now build a stronger future not just for themselves but for the generations that follow next we traveled to Zambia and visited our friend Dora from one of our previous projects 5 years ago she moved to mapapa along with four adopted children and started making Tik Tok videos to raise money to build a school and Village for kids in desperate need and very quickly her account grew to over 4 million followers and she now cares for almost 400 children but despite her best efforts the cost of supporting all these kids is an ongoing Challenge and along with many other problems they were facing Dora's Village was still in need of basic necessities so we got to work and put in a well for fresh drinking water bought Dora a brand new car so she wouldn't break down on her long Journeys for supplies installed internet so she can continue making content to generate the funds needed to support the kids tripled their solar capacity and rebuilt a dormatory that was destroyed in a devastating storm so as of today this house will no longer be called the boy's house it will be called the be philanthropy every one of us has the ability to make a difference in somebody else's life next we went to Kenya where we visited the Mara and met up with the local Rangers that protect the endangered Wildlife lack of electricity and monitoring equipment have made their jobs far more difficult and dangerous we met with Daniel the CEO of the mesai conserves to learn more about the challenges they face the downfall in the mara all started 60 years ago when the land was divided and given to the Masai people for private ownership this led to investors buying the land for development and exploitation of resources many Masai had no choice but to accept the money abandoning their ancestral heritage and putting the habitat that millions of Masai and animals rely on at risk of being destroyed to combat this problem the conservancies came up with environmentally friendly revenue streams that could be used to lease the land from the landowners so that it could be conserved and protected for the MSI people and the animals to help the Massi conservancies we worked with give power to provide the ranger stations with clean renewable energy so they never have to work in the dark again we also provided them with enough funds for seven new weather stations which now collect data needed to generate carbon credits to fund the expansion of the MSI Conservancy this project allows them to have a sustainable source of income to continue their work and keep the mara as it was for centuries those people who are considered as custodians of wild animals are now benefiting because it is actually providing income to thousands and thousands of households we're also ensuring that the new generations will have to continue what we have started after tens of thousands of requests we finally made our way to India starting in New Delhi for not one but two projects first Darren met with Dr Modi the founder of the Udan care program where orphaned and abandoned children are given a loving and caring environment to give them a fair chance at a life different to the one they were born into we were so moved by the exceptional work of Udan care that we decided to fund all operating costs for the shelter in new daily for a year as well as pay for 280 scholarship after we wrapped up that project Darren traveled to Kolkata for the most heartbreaking project we have done to date where young children work up to 14 hours a day collecting scrap in dangerous landfills in the the hopes of salvaging enough scrap to buy a bowl of rice without access to an education these children have no hope of a future Beyond these trash dumps it is because of a nonprofit called tala shed that tens of thousands of underprivileged children have been rescued from the dumps and are now getting an education and a chance at a better life to help tiljala expand their operation and create more opportunities for these children we funded the entire tiljala shed program for the whole year while we were working with tiljala we learned that many of these children come from homes where there is not enough food to eat a single meal every day so Darren called some of his old friends who agreed to fund a food program for at least 2 years and then another huge shout out to Tony and Sage Robbins who saw the video and immediately pledged to fund the entire program for an additional year as well as extend the food program for two additional years now is a great time to mention something else on almost every project we've done the organizations we highlight get incredible support from around the world when people see the outstanding work they do and the difference they make this is one of the ways we make a much bigger difference than just what is shown in this video and we couldn't do any of this without you while we were in India we launched another project with a toy company called play Shifu they make incredible educational toys and donated $1 million Worth to give to underprivileged children around the world the kids really enjoy playing with these toys without even realizing that they are learning I wish I had stuff like that when I was in school is going to go on to bless 190 pediatric cancer Warriors thank you guys so much we are so happy thank you thank you thank you so much this year we managed to complete four projects in America five if you count the more than 20 million pounds of food we distributed to food insecure people across the country but that is an ongoing project and we didn't make a video it's really kind of crazy when you think about it for years ago we started with a goal of Distributing 400,000 meals a year now we're doing over 20 million and we are aiming to double it again next year the first video in America was with our long-term Partners at electric ebikes W together we gave away over 600 electric bikes across the country to people who needed transportation to get to school work medical appointments and just have reliable transportation thank you Mr be cuz now I I won't be standing Ste I'll be slowly moving forward to the next goal in my life we then visited a nonprofit school in Atlanta where the kids sing and dance in class Ron and Kim the founders of this amazing school have discovered a different way to interact with kids that actually makes education fun they have taught their method to over 100,000 teachers around the world and the results are always the same incredible so we decided to partner up with stand together and victra to pay for over 200 teachers from around the country to visit the Ron Clark Academy in Atlanta so that they could take this program back to their own schools when you affect the life of a child you do not only affect the life of that child everybody that one day that child's life will have an impact upon every teacher needs to realize it could be in the millions of lives but really we just want to make great people who love others and want to use their talents to make a difference in the lives of the people that they're around for the next project we traveled to Texas where we met up with David you visualize the last time you wish you didn't wake up David was an NFL star who found a stronger purpose helping people who had suffered catastrophic injuries adapt to their new lives this was one of the most inspiring videos we have ever done I was presented with the opportunity to come to the Adaptive training Foundation it was life-changing I don't believe there's anything that you can't do you just have to find an adaptable way to do it understanding the adversity these people had faced and seeing them overcome a devastating and permanent injury only to become stronger and more confident is a great lesson to all of us for when we are faced with adversity together with stand together we donated $250,000 to ATF so David can help more people as well as train more coaches to spread his program across the world we we're not going to make this gym about changing the world for them we wanted to change them for the world and for our last project of 2024 we traveled to Tampa Florida to work with an organization who are literally giving people their smiles back severe dental disease robs people of their confidence their health and worst of all their smiles which are such an essential form of human interaction and it was a certain picture that I looked at like this is not me like a smile to me means a lot I've had little kids point out going Mommy what's wrong with her mouth I mean it's embarrassing I don't have any pictures with milestones in my kid' life because I wouldn't smile and I would me on camera nuvia dental implants donated a million dollar in services to give 20 patients a million new reasons to smile our goal is to not only put smiles back on the faces of
