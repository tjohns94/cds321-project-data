So, we kicked off the Lifetime store in Mexico City last Wednesday, but before we did, I asked for the whole running time of the whole show. This includes the songs, the videos in between, which we call interstitials, and all the intro outro music. You will never believe how long this show is. You want to guess? Take a wild guess.
