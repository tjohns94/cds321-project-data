    "transcript": "sponsored by the Pokemon Company International. Hi guys, today I'm at the Pokemon Mega Evolution event. I am so excited to get the most rare card. This is such a cool event. I am on my way to open my Pokémon cards. I'm so excited. I hope I get a rare one. [Music] I don't know how much tattoos are here, but hopefully they can fit on my arm. H how much do you think these tattoos I can get? If no, if there's no room on my legs. One more. Perfect. Hopefully, you can come to this event. Finally, I can open the Pokémon cards. I am so excited to open these. I wanted this one. Ivysaur. I can't wait to open all of them. Guys, you can find this collection in store right now. One star. One star. Two stars. I got a two star. I finished all the cards and opened them. I got a bunch of one stars and I got six um two stars. The air balloon two stars is my favorite. I wish for you guys to have a two star and maybe I can switch with you. And this one I will never trade because it's the most rare. Now let's battle. I hope you get the ones you want. Bye.",
