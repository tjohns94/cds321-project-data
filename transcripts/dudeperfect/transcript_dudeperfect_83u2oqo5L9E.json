Which bagel bite are you taking first? >> First of all, tip of the cap to this guy who put 24 Bites on his plate. >> I have my first round pick. I'm actually going 13. And you might think it's a little asymmetrical. Here's my thought process. You grab the nonsaued cheese side so you know your fingers are safe. What that allows you to do is still have room to bite mostly bread, but a little bit of sauce while keeping your lip a little high so you can bite into it and you're not getting that burn right there. >> You guys are two bite bagels. >> I got a problem with it, Ty. And that's the fact that you're three bite in your first bite. You've got to go and set the tone on the opening kick. You got to go full bagel bite right off the bat. >> You cannot take a bagel bite out of the oven and go a full bite all the way in the mouth. The ugly duckling in the group 23. 23 is ugly. >> Oh, 23. >> Hey, almost badly.",
