And to prove it, I'm going to be deleting this channel. It breaks my heart how many people are are leaving hate comments about how I fell off and unsubscribing and saying they don't like me anymore. It It really hurts. Um, but honestly, you know, no one's really watching the videos anyways, so you guys probably won't miss me too much. And, uh, I guess in reality, I don't really enjoy filming these videos either. So, uh, unless some sort of miracle happens right now, it is time to delete my channel. Jesus. >> What the hell? >> Hi, Nick. It's me, Jesus Christ. [Music] >> I know you want to quit YouTube, but don't. Even though your views are down right now, your real loyal subscribers want you to keep posting. Don't give up. We all love you. Oh, and by the way, check that darn box. [Music]",
