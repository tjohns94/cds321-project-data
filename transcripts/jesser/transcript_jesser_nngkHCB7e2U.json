    "transcript": "This weird supermarket has five secret rooms, and I'm going to uncover all of them. I started by walking around the supermarket and noticed the meat room was looking sus. Hell no. What the hell is that? I want to lease some of meat. That's crazy. And I was right. The back of the meat place led me to a whole different galaxy. That's one room down, four more to go. As I was walking by, I saw the janitor room. Janitors are always sus. When I walked in there, there was some of the weirdest items I had ever seen in my life. What kind of janitor is this? But that was another secret room found. This was not a normal supermarket. Mammoth chunks, tattooed chicken, $3,000 cheese, protein, toothpaste, and then I stumbled upon this weird detergent. Dark detergent. I knew something was up. And I was right. Another secret entrance. I just needed to find two more secret rooms. And I kept looking and looking until I stumbled upon this tent. The whole thing was just looking sus. So I had to investigate it more. And I found a secret tunnel in there. And that means there was only one more secret room to find. So, let's see if you can subscribe before I find it. Maybe it's behind the avocado flavored French fries. Nope. These sodas looked absolutely delicious. So, I went to grab one and boom, I found the final secret",
