Well, I got invited to a Pokemon event where they were celebrating the launch of the Pokemon Mega Evolution Discovery. And inside, they had these massive versions of some of the cards that you could pull in the booster pack. >> What's the best card you pulled? >> Not the rarest park, but pretty sick. >> Damn, it's almost time to rip. I wonder which card we're going to pull today. Let's go. It's about time we open these. Here we go. Ooh. Save it. >> While I was opening packs, Ben managed to pull a golden card. One of the absolute rarest. And I knew I had to find one. >> No, I'm just pulling heat after heat. Sleeve it. >> Z pack right here. >> Sleeve it. A rare candy. Sleeve it. >> These are some of my favorite cards that I pulled. The artwork on them is next level. Now it's time for Ben and I to pull some heat. If you guys want to open cards like these yourselves, make sure to pick up a Pokemon Mega Evolution.",
