    "transcript": "Everyone is asking me how I built this three-way opening door. It's a door that opens three different sizes. Let me paint it and I'll show you how >> it's done. Let me show you how these three doors open and I will answer all of your questions in the comments to tell you exactly how I built this thing because wasn't that hard. Now, the big door is the boring one. Let me show you the archway. Look at this doorork knob right here. It's really cool. And I have to show you the hinges on the other side. Like I said, I'll tell you exactly where I got everything for this in the comments, but the hinges posed an interesting problem for how you hinge three doors. And the last one, my favorite precisely etched photograph. I'll explain it. Uh, but look at this. Just ask me in the comments and I'll show you because the hinges pose the most difficult challenge. And I'll explain why in the comments. But we have these guys. These hinges in this position allow for this to open up all the way out of the way. A total cutout. And that is three doors that can open in three different ways.",
