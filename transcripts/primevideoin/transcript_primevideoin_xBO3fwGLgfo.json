Yeah, so my father had an astrologer\nwho once said that I would marry Akshay Kumar. And I didn't know him,\nand then I married him. -Really?\n-Yeah. -That was true.\n-Wow. He was a very good astrologer.\nI mean, 18 years ago, he said I'd become a well-known\nwriter, I hadn't written a thing. So, yeah. You want his number,\nI can give it to you. -I don't think I want to--\n-He stays in Delhi. I don't want to know the future. I like the uncertainty. -Absolutely. We were also not sure--\n-Deep. Very deep.\nI must say, very deep. I mean, a lot of uncertainty.\nWe didn't know this was going to be… But wait, what happened? -He predicted the marriage?\n-He predicted that, -but we didn't really believe him.\n-He told your dad about it. He told my dad. We actually met\nbecause of my dad. My dad had an old\nproducer friend. And you know, like how\nsome emperor says, \"I have commanded\nthat this happens!\" My father said, you have to work in\nthis movie because I have given my word. -And she didn't want to work with me.\n-And I didn't want to work with him at that point, but I did. She was literally pushed\nin that film. Just do this film! -It was not because of you. She just--\n-It was because of me. -Because of me. Ask her.\n-No! -Ask her.\n-Because she was working with amazing people like me. -We didn't--\n-So she said, not him. Why didn't you want to work with him? He was going through a bad phase.\nI was being snobby. I had given a lot of flops,\nso she didn't want to work with me. -You've always given some flops.\n-Many flops? And then super hits.\nSo, who cares?",
