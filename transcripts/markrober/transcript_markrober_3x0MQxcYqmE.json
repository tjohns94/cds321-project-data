Turns out the actual sharpest blade ever discovered is from 700,000 years ago. Now, here's what most people think is the sharpest, a super sharp chef's knife. And while that's probably the sharpest thing in your house, it turns out this edge is 4,000 atoms thick. Now, for comparison, a really thin human hair is 100,000 atoms thick. Now, for the sharpest blade in any hospital, you've got the surgical scalpel. With an edge of 2,000 atoms thick, it's twice as sharp as a kitchen knife. And now, for the sharpest blade in the known world, this is obsidian, volcanic glass that forms when lava cools really fast, and its edge is 200 times sharper than a scalpel, coming in at just 10 atoms thick. Proof that sometimes mother nature still holds the high score. Which begs the question,",
