    "transcript": "Did you know the reason spider legs curl up when they die is the same reason you can bring them back to life? With this tiny little pump? The answer actually has to do with this giant excavator. Because they use something called hydraulics. That's when you use fluid pressure to move things. As the fluid enters this chamber, it forces the piston to extend and that causes the arm to rotate. Well, spiders do the same thing only with their blood. So, when their heart pumps blood into the legs, they extend out like this. And then when they pull the blood out, they contract like this. And so just by doing this one leg at a time, they're able to crawl forward like this. So this means when they die, there's no more pressure in the system and all of the legs contract. But here's the coolest part. Once they go to spider heaven, we can hijack the system on our own. Stay with me for a second, even if you hate spiders, cuz this is incredible. Okay, I swear you're going to love this. You got this. Okay, removing the blur in three, two, one. Check that out. Look at those legs expand and then contract when the pressure goes away. Now, watch this. And if this works, you have to subscribe to see more cool stuff like this. We can actually pick stuff up. I told you that would be worth it. Oh, crud. Where'd it go? Ah. Oh, got it.",
