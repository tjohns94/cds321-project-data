    "transcript": "This is the world's most simple record player and recorder. Cuz if you look real close at a vinyl record, you'll notice a tiny bumpy groove running around in a spiral around the whole thing. When you put it in any record player, the needle goes in that groove and vibrates left to right as it traces all the bumps. But these aren't random bumps. Cuz if you were to play the same song out loud next to the needle, the sound waves in the air will make it vibrate side to side in the exact same way. The grooves make it vibrate side to side. The grooves are literally replaying the song. It's the same principle as when I yell here. The needle vibrates, carving in those vibrations into the spinning aluminum foil. Now we have a map of my voice. So if we drag the needle along this trail again, we can repeat the exact same vibration, literally playing my yell back. >> Subscribe.",
