    "transcript": "These are two professional suma wrestlers. And these are two ordinary phone books. And I'm offering them $10,000 a piece if they can pull them apart. See the catch? I'm going to interlace the pages like this. No glue, no tricks, just paper. Now, I'm pretty sure my $20,000 is safe thanks to something called contact friction. Because while pulling out a single page requires a tiny bit of force, when you add that up almost a thousand times, that friction adds up real fast. 3 2 1 go. Now, even though they're pulling with over 200 lb of force, these two little foam books aren't even flinching. Tell you what, boys. Hop in these trucks, and if they get it, I'll still give them $20,000. But you have to subscribe. 3 2 1 go. Even with thousands of pounds of force, they still don't stand a chance. Woo! And that's how you earn $20,000 and no new subscribers. Huh? Should have thought about that.",
