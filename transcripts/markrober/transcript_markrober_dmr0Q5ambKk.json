    "transcript": "Can you really breathe with a bamboo reed underwater like they do in the cartoons? >> Well, let's run an experiment with these three different length bamboo reads. Starting first with one foot. Here we go. Okay, that was possible but not that easy. That's because that's like trying to breathe with five bowling balls on your chest. Now for two feet. [Music] That was really hard. And there's a reason for that. Because the deeper you go, the more water there is pushing down on you. And since a gallon of water weighs as much as a gallon of human, don't worry, it's not real human. It's harder to breathe the lower you go in water. In the same way, it's harder to breathe the lower you go in a human dog pile. For proof, watch what happens to this water bottle when I bring it to the deep end of the pool. The bottle represents my lungs getting squeezed by all the heavy water above it, and it doesn't have the strength to push back. >> All right, moment of truth. three feet. Wow, that's totally impossible. So, yes, you could breathe underwater with the reed, but if you're going any deeper than 2 feet, you're going to need some gills.",
