Stands looking after baby. It's the nicest thing to do. Stan's looking after baby. He loves looking after you. We're having fun. Then you start to cry because you're little. You can't say why. Do you like this? Do you like that? I tickle your feet. Yes, you like that. Stan's looking after baby. It's the nicest thing to do. Stan's looking after baby. He loves looking after you. You are so cute and look so happy. It's time for food. Are you hungry? Let's have some ice cream and candies, too. Picnic in the living room for me and you. Stan's looking after baby. It's the nicest thing to do. Stan can't wait till the next time. He looks after you. [Music]",
