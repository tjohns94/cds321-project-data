The firefighters of Looney Boy want us to build a fire truck. That way, they can get around easier to help those in need. >> Let's imagine a fire truck for Patunia and Gossamer. >> They'll need a big vehicle with a powerful engine so they can get places real fast. Flashing lights and a wild siren will aait to stay out of the way. >> How about a a long ladder for anyone making rescues that are up high? >> And the best part, the big old hose that sprays water to put out the fires. Woohoo! Now that's a fine looking fire truck. >> It's hot hat time. Let's build this fire truck. >> First, we need to assemble the body of the vehicle. [Music] Time to add the tires. Very nice. The engine's next. That's it, Lola. Push it in nice and easy. [Music] This engine is ready to roar. Fire it up, Daffy. [Music] >> Hey, Gossamer. >> Sounds like a catastrophe. Help is on the way. We got to go. Sylvester's stuck in a tree and Gossamer can't get him down. >> Mommy, but the truck isn't finished yet. We still need to add the lights, the sirens, ladder, and hose. >> We'll just have to build as we go. Duty calls. [Music] Let's roll. Don't worry, little buddy. Help is on the way. >> Thank goodness you're here. Sylvester's stuck way up there. >> Suffering suckage. Why did I climb a tree when I'm afraid of heights? >> Evil, we need the ladder that we haven't built yet. >> Then we better step to it. Now to secure the side rails and add the steps in between. >> Let's get this cat out of the tree. >> We're coming, buddy. >> Okay, >> I'll help you. >> I'm out of the tree. [Music] >> Don't worry. I'll carry you down. Safe and sound on the ground.",
