When you feel a little scared on your own, just remember that I'm always here. You'll never be alone. And you know I've got you. And I know you got me, too. >> Don't be scared. It's all right. When it's dark, we'll shine a light into the night. Into the night. Oh, don't be scared. It's all right. I'll look after you always. >> It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay. >> Don't worry. We'll find the monster. There's nothing hiding in the closet. Nothing underneath your bed. Just try and listen to my voice and remember what I said. A little light is all we need. Light up the dark so we can all see. You'll be okay if you just stick with me. And you know I've got you. I know you got me. >> Don't be scared. It's all right. When it's dark, we'll shine a light into the night. Into the night. Oh, don't be scared. It's all right. I'll look at you always. It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay. Oh, I'll be close. I'll be there. We stick together when we're scared. I'll hold your hand. You say it's going to be okay. It's going to be okay. >> Huh? Wait, that's not a monster. Oh, don't be scared. It's all right. And it's dark. We'll shine a light into the into the night. Oh, don't be scared. It's all right. I'll look after you always. It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay. Oh. [Music]",
