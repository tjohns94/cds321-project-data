We've got to shut off the engine before it crashes into the waterfront. But how? It's not safe to get on board if it's on fire. I've got it. Rubble, get your dump truck and hurry to the Adventure Bay Bridge. I'll tell you the plan when I get to the pier. Rubble, on the double for redhot trouble. [Music] Look, Rubble's on the bridge. >> Marshall Tazuma, we have a plan to put out the flounder fire. Once it's out, we need Captain Turbet back on board to cut the engine. >> We'll do. All right, Rubble. As soon as the flounder goes under the bridge, dump all the sand you've got onto the fire. It should be enough to smother the flames and put them out for good. I can dig it, Marshall. And I can dump it, too. Ready, steady, now. Woohoo! Perfect shot.",
