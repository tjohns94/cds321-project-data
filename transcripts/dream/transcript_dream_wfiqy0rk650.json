Yes. >> What? >> This video, five of my friends try and hunt me down and stop me from beating Minecraft. I said we would do five hunters if the four hunter series got 1 million likes, and it did in less than a day. Can they stop me from beating the Ender Dragon, or will I survive? I beat them twice, they beat me twice. This is it for all the marbles. The final Minecraft manhunt. But if this video gets 2 million likes, we'll do a Minecraft manhunt in real life when George comes to America, which is pretty soon. We even scouted an area for it. And we might consider doing six hunters way in the future if you like the video enough. And as always, only a small percentage of people that watch my videos are actually subscribed. So if you want to help us reach 30 million, please subscribe. It's free. You can always change your mind later. Love you guys. Enjoy the grand finale. >> Dream. >> What? >> Wait, that's not fair. >> I got hit. >> What if What if I didn't want to go this way? Let's do the thing. Let's do the thing.
