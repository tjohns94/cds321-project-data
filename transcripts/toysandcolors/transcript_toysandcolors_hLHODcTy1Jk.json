One, make sure to have water breaks. Drink a full glass of water before play or physical activity begins. Then remember to take water breaks at 30inut intervals. Two, bring water rich snacks. Juice popsicles. Watermelon, grapes, and orange slices are great snacks during summer. Three, make it fun. Serving water in a fun glass with silly straws. Add herbs and berries for extra flare. Better yet, freeze juice into ice cubes to make plain water a bit sweeter. Four, go beyond water. If we exercise or play in the sun for more than 90 minutes at a stretch, make sure to have some electrolytes in your drinks. The reason when we get overheated and dehydrated, they're not just losing water. They're sweating out electrolytes like sodium, potassium, and chloride. Electrolyte solutions like Capri Sun Sports Juice boxes, smart water, and Gatorade are all solid options. [Music] Wo! [Music] Spider webs. Ew. >> A >> what? So empty. Ah, [Music] >> perfect.
