A [Music] >> I need my green Play-Doh. It's missing. Maybe I'm just imagining things. I'll just get another one. Where's all my stuff? >> Oh no. >> Huh? >> Bobby, the monster took it. >> No, Maddie. Monsters aren't real. Let me look around. H. >> Ooh, slime. [Music] H I want to play with my red slime. My red slime is missing. H Where's that red slime? >> Huh? >> Oh no. Where's all my slime? >> Wendy. Wendy. The monsters took your slime. >> I don't know, Maddie. Maybe you're scared from staying up too late. >> But I'm telling the truth. Time to get more evidence. The trail goes this way. H. Where did they go? >> I'm almost done working on this car. I need another wrench. Where is that wrench? [Music] What? A shovel. >> Huh? >> Where is my wrench? >> I must be imagining things. [Music] >> I knew it. >> One last part. >> What? What? Where's my stuff? >> Someone took my Play-Doh. Yeah. And someone took my slime. >> Who could have possibly taken all of her stuff? >> It was the monster. The one under the bed. >> But Maddie, monsters aren't real. >> But it's true. >> Huh? [Music] >> See, I told you. >> Wa! She was right. >> Sorry, I didn't believe you, Maddie. >> Monster. >> Maybe we can catch it. So, the monster likes to take things while we're not paying attention. We can trick it by putting stuff that it wants near the bed and pretending not to look. I'll be on standby, ready to catch the monster. Everyone knows the plan. Let's catch this monster. >> Monster. >> Go, go, go. Catch it. Catch it. >> That must be the monster's hideout. >> Yeah. [Music] Wa! What is this place? [Music] >> All my toys. >> The monster. The dinosaur. >> Give us our stuff back. >> Yeah. >> No, they belong to me now. >> The Play-Doh. My slime. >> My tools. >> Maybe he wants his own stuff. >> Huh? You can have this toy. >> Huh? Really? No one's really given me anything before. You know what? Thanks for being nice. You can have all your stuff back. >> Yay! >> Wow! Yes! Thanks for giving us our stuff back. >> Yay! [Music] >> Out of my way. >> That was rude. Let me go fix it. Let me help fix you, little robot. >> Whatever. >> What's wrong with the robot? What are we going to do? Let's go. >> I'm glad this is over. Not exactly. >> Still learning table. >> Let's set the table. >> Okay. Observation. >> Wow. [Music] Oo, [Music] >> thank you. Wow, these are the politest robots ever. >> Yay. >> Respect personal boundaries. Let's begin. [Music] on your left. >> Oh, excuse me. On your right. >> Thank yous and no thank yous. Blue robot is assigned to get healthy drinks. We're getting healthy cereal. Let's practice our no thank yous and thank yous. Do you want this soda? >> Is that healthy? >> I don't think so, too. >> No, thank you. >> Okay. What about this grape juice? It's made of real grapes. >> That must be healthy, right? Yeah, that's right. >> Yes, please. >> Two more drinks. >> How about this banana soda? >> M. This is tricky. You're right. It's still a soda, so it's not healthy. >> No, thank you. >> Oh, okay. How about this blueberry juice? >> Is blueberry a fruit? Yes, it is. >> Yes, please. >> Here you go. How about this? >> No, thank you. >> Oh, okay. You're so funny, robot. >> This is definitely healthy. Hair juice. >> Yes, please. >> Ellie, your turn. >> Thank you, Andrea. All right, let's begin. >> It's just candy cereal. >> Yep, it's just candy. >> Yeah, that's not healthy. >> No, thank you. >> Oh, of course. Let's put this away.

What about Uncle Sam's healthiest fruit cereal? >> Fruit is always healthy. >> Yes, please. >> All right. Which one is healthy? >> Infinity Pebbles. All sugar. Fancy Best bites. >> Which one? >> I think all sugar is the bad one. >> No, thank you. >> They're ready to be delivered. Yay. They're ready. [Music] >> Wow, you girls are amazing. We love our robots.

I'm not Uncle Chip. I'm Sir Isaac Newton. [Music] >> When that apple landed on my head, I thought, why did it go down and not up? >> Gravity. >> What's gravity? >> When you jump and land back on the ground, that's gravity. Oh, >> but all my items are slow. >> Allow me to demonstrate. >> Friction. Your Rubik's cube has more friction than this tennis ball. >> I still don't get it. >> The surface drags the cube while the ball rolls. >> Oh, okay. I think I got it. >> Find another item with less friction. It will go faster. >> Ready, set, go. Ooh, maybe this one has less friction. >> Awesome. [Music] >> Cool. >> Oh, perfect. >> Welcome back.

Which one? >> May I have the white one, please? >> Yeah, absolutely. Oh, let me wash my hands really quick. [Music] Oh, that looks slippery. Go clumsy me. My hands are so slippery from the soap. >> Actually, may I borrow the soap instead? >> Uh, okay. Careful. It's slippery. >> Thank you. [Music] >> Please, please, please. [Music] >> I won. >> Congratulations. >> Well done. You applied what you learned about gravity and fiction. >> Thank you for your guidance, Sir Isaac Newton. >> Bye. >> Wait. Bonus round.
