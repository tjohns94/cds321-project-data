    "transcript": "Today we're going to see how many packs I have to open up to get the rarest gold Pokemon card for my wife. So, I took my wife Michelle with me to the Pokemon Mega Experience to open up a ton of packs. We looked around and saw a ton of cool Pokémon artwork and sculptures. We even saw dancing Pikachu. And of course, we had to do a little dance with him. My wife looks so cute dancing with Pikachu. Hopefully, I can get her the Pokémon card she wants. Now, it's time to start opening the packs. Pokémon was nice enough to give us a few hundred packs to open. Here we go. The first pack. Okay, >> I didn't get the gold Pokémon card she wanted, >> but we still have a ton to go. I started to open more packs and we got a lot of cool cards, but no gold one yet. I even had my wife kiss this one for good luck. Let's see if we get it. Okay, maybe after some more we'll get it. After I opened more packs, I decided I needed a break and let my wife open a few packs, too, since she was feeling a bit left out. We pulled so many rares and crazy looking illustration cards, but no gold one yet. I was starting to lose hope, but at least we were having a ton of fun together, and I think this entire experience was amazing. We continued opening more and more packs and stumbled across even more cool cards. You can tell how many packs we opened up by looking at all the packs laying on the side of the table. This is actually kind of insane. And just as I was opening my last few packs, I saw a gold card. There it is. I did it. I gave it to my wife Michelle and she was so happy. Look at her face. And she crowned me the best husband for finding the card for her.",
