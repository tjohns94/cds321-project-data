    "transcript": "Dressing my wife up as K-pop demon hunters in Fortnite. Level one, Mera. >> This video is sponsored by Epic Games. >> This costume turned out so cool. Michelle even has a spear exactly like Mirror's. Level 50, Zoe. This Zoe costume is so cute. I've never seen Michelle rock a hairstyle like this. And honestly, I like it a lot. If you love K-pop demon hunters, Fortnite has released new outfits for Meera, Zoe, and Roomie. Level 100 Roomie. This costume on Michelle looks incredible. She's wielding a sword and also has a super cool bright yellow jacket that pairs perfectly with Roomy's long purple braid. This is definitely my favorite one on Michelle. There is also a new game mode called Demon Rush where you fight hordes of demons. It's so much fun fighting demons as my favorite Hunrix members. This is a limited time experience, so go >> check out Kbomb Demon Hunters now in Fortnite.",
